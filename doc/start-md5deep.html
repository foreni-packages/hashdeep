<h2 id="install">Installing md5deep </h2>

<h3 id="windowsinstall"> Microsoft Windows </h3>

<p>
Users running Microsoft Windows are strongly encouraged to download the precompiled binaries
from <a href="http://md5deep.sourceforge.net/">http://md5deep.sourceforge.net/</a>. 

Please note that these binaries are created using a Mingw cross compiler.
Compiling the programs directly from Windows <em>is not supported</em>.

</p>


<h3 id="autoinstall"> Automatic Installation </h3>

Before you try to install md5deep manually, see if your operating system supports
the programs via an automatic installation method. Some operating systems that
provide this feature for md5deep are:

</p>
<p>

<!-- Apparently Cygwin is no longer supported (jk 17 Dec 2010) 
<strong> Cygwin: </strong>
<a href="http://cygwinports.dotsrc.org/">Cygwin Ports</a> 
-->

<br>

<strong>Mac OS X: </strong>
<a href="http://md5deep.darwinports.com/">DarwinPorts</a>, 
<a href="http://pdb.finkproject.org/pdb/package.php/md5deep">Fink</a>

<br>

<strong> Linux: </strong>
<a href="http://packages.ubuntu.com/maverick/md5deep">Ubuntu</a>,
<a href="http://www.spinics.net/lists/fedora-package-announce/msg51206.html">Fedora</a>,
<a href="http://gentoo-portage.com/app-crypt/md5deep">Gentoo</a>,
<a href="http://slackbuilds.org/repository/13.1/system/md5deep/">Slackware</a>

<br>

<strong> BSD: </strong>
<a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/ports/security/md5deep/">FreeBSD</a>

</p>


<h3 id="manualinstall"> Manual installation </h3>

<p>
If your operating system does not support the automatic installation
methods described above, you will have to download the source code
and compile the programs yourself.
First download the latest tarball of the program from 
<a href="http://md5deep.sourceforge.net/">http://md5deep.sourceforge.net/</a>. This file
should be named something like <tt>md5deep-3.7.tar.gz</tt>. Uncompress the file with the
following command:

<pre>    $ tar zxvf md5deep-4.1.tar.gz </pre>

</p>
<p>

Change into the decompressed directory

<pre>    $ cd md5deep-4.1 </pre>

and configure the program.

<pre>    $ ./configure </pre>

The configure script can accept lots of options. Run <tt>./configure --help</tt> for the
complete list. The most common option used is the <tt>prefix</tt> option which installs
the program in a location other than the default, <tt>/usr/local/bin</tt>. If you wanted
to install the program elsewhere, for example, <tt>/tmp/md5deep</tt>, you would
run <tt> ./configure --prefix=/tmp/md5deep</tt> instead.

</p>
<p>

You can now compile the program using the make command:

<pre>    $ make </pre>

and install it:

<pre>    $ make install </pre>

Note that you must be root on most operating systems to install the program to its
default location, <tt>/usr/local/bin</tt>. The tool <tt>sudo</tt> may help:

<pre>    $ sudo make install </pre>

<br>
</p>



<h2 id="basic"> Basic Operation </h2>

<h3 id="commandprompt"> Opening a command prompt </h3>

<p>
md5deep is a command line program. You cannot run the program by 
double clicking on it! On Microsoft Windows, click on the Start button
and choose "Run..." from the menu. In this dialog box, type <tt>cmd.exe</tt>
and hit enter. A command prompt should appear. In this window, type
the full path to md5deep.exe and then the files you want to hash.
For example:

<pre> c:\Documents and Settings\jessek\Desktop\md5deep.exe c:\Windows\*</pre>

Note that you <em>can</em> drag the md5deep icon into this window and
the operating system will fill in the path information for you. 
You can also install the programs in a directory that is included in
your <tt>PATH</tt> environment variable.

</p>


<h3> Computing hashes </h3>

By default, md5deep generates MD5 hashes for each input file, 
displaying the full path information for each file:

<pre>$ md5deep config.h INSTALL README
b08b18e0a3d2440feb0b321ea8080b36  /home/jessek/coreutils-5.2.0/config.h
9f3e20fdff9c78aa8e3f9b42be166769  /home/jessek/coreutils-5.2.0/INSTALL
4aa18483f73fc56c907f0ae9025e2582  /home/jessek/coreutils-5.2.0/README</pre>

If no input files are specified, standard input is hashed. You can either
pipe the output of other programs into md5deep or type manually at the 
command line. To end input from the command line, most shells use 
Control-D, except for Microsoft Windows, which uses Control-Z.

<pre>$ uname -a | md5deep
f54c5e12c13791b67d299221424a5d80

$ md5deep
This is a test  
[Enter and Control-D hit]
ff22941336956098ae9a564289d1bf1b</pre>

You can also have md5deep print relative filenames instead of absolute
ones. That is, omit all of the path information except that specified 
on the command line. To enable relative paths, use the <tt>-l</tt> flag. 
Repeating our first example with the <tt>-l</tt> flag:

<pre>$ md5deep -l ../*
b08b18e0a3d2440feb0b321ea8080b36  ../config.h
9f3e20fdff9c78aa8e3f9b42be166769  ../INSTALL
4aa18483f73fc56c907f0ae9025e2582  ../README</pre>

You can have md5deep only print out the basename of each 
file it processes. That is, all directory information will be stripped
off. To enable basename mode, use the <tt>-b</tt> flag:

<pre>$ md5deep -b config.h INSTALL README
b08b18e0a3d2440feb0b321ea8080b36  config.h
9f3e20fdff9c78aa8e3f9b42be166769  INSTALL
4aa18483f73fc56c907f0ae9025e2582  README</pre>

Finally, if you need md5deep to insert an asterisk before the filename,
similar to how md5sum does when you use the -b flag with that program,
you can use the -k flag on md5deep. 

<pre>$ md5deep -k config.h INSTALL README
b08b18e0a3d2440feb0b321ea8080b36 */home/jessek/coreutils-5.2.0/config.h
9f3e20fdff9c78aa8e3f9b42be166769 */home/jessek/coreutils-5.2.0/INSTALL
4aa18483f73fc56c907f0ae9025e2582 */home/jessek/coreutils-5.2.0/README</pre>

<br>
<h2 id="error"> Error messages </h2>

If an input file can't be found, an error message is normally printed.
These, and all other error messages, can be surpressed by using the 
<tt>-s</tt> flag.

<pre>$ md5deep doesnotexist.txt
md5deep: /home/jessek/doesnotexist.txt: No such file or directory

$ md5deep -s doesnotexist.txt
$</pre>


<br>
<h2 id="recursive">Recursive Mode</h2>

Normally, attempting to process a directory will generate an error message.
Under recursive mode, md5deep will hash files in the current directory
<em>and</em> file in subdirectories. 
Recursive mode is activated by using 
the <tt>-r</tt> flag.

<pre>$ md5deep *
md5deep: /home/jessek/archives: Is a directory
md5deep: /home/jessek/bin: Is a directory

$ md5deep -r *
ea024eaf04ee7a2a4270655d584445d2  /home/jessek/archives/coreutils-5.2.0.tar.bz2
a07715c3344524da1270e9eb39f9b9e1  /home/jessek/archives/md5deep-0.16.tar.gz
ef62d2a26c266df6151ae35447bfd2ad  /home/jessek/archives/dcfldd-1.0.tar.gz
fb3dab239dd0baa0f4a1ccb10c3a5b0a  /home/jessek/bin/hex2dec</pre>


<br>
<h2 id="time"> Time Estimation Mode </h2>

When processing large files, it is sometimes helpful to have an estimate
of the time remaining in the operation. md5deep can generate an estimate
of how long it will take to finish processing the <em>current file</em>.
The <tt>-e</tt> flag prints this estimate to standard error, like this:

<pre>$ md5deep -e /dev/hda1
hda1: 1MB of 47MB done, 00:00:46 left
</pre>

When the file is completed, the last time estimate is removed and the
hash is displayed:

<pre>$ md5deep -e /dev/hda1
ca1b8297dbceaa14682d889483320a1a  /dev/hda1
</pre>


<h2 id="size"> File Size Mode </h2>

md5deep can optionally display a ten digit representation of each
file's size along with the hash. The file size comes before the hash
on the line. This mode is activated with the <em>-z</em> flag, like this:

<pre>$ md5deep -z *.h
      1666  3a5353527e28b1cb5b844d602094c25a  /home/jessek/md5deep/src/algorithms.h
      1232  a27d2799c36c7c64e370bf480dd463c0  /home/jessek/md5deep/src/hashTable.h
      1880  d8defb61898fe255c6d66c4d880a8536  /home/jessek/md5deep/src/md5.h</pre>

Note that ten spaces are used, even if the file size doesn't require that
much space. This is done to make sorting easier.

<p>

If the file size is larger than 9,999,999,999 bytes (about 9.3 GB), the
program will display the size as 9999999999. 
</p>
<br>

<h2 id="match"> Matching mode </h2>

One of the more powerful features of md5deep is the ability to match
the hashes of input files against a list of known hashes. You can
do both <em>postive matching</em>, which displays those files that
<b>do</b> match the list of known hashes, or <em>negative matching</em>,
which displays those files that <b>do not</b> match the list of known
hashes.

<h3>Positive Matching</h3>

Let's say that we have a text file <tt>known-hashes.txt</tt> which
contains a few hashes:

<pre>65e7d67f9dbc831d4334f23c7fb9cfb1  foo.doc
406f25e49e9e08bb859b574a96746177  bar.gif</pre>

You can use hash files generated by md5deep, md5sum, md5 (found on *BSD 
systems), Hashkeeper, iLook,
and the National Software Reference Library.
We can specify to use this file for positive matching by using the
<tt>-m</tt> flag. Then, any input files that match either of these
hashes will be displayed.

<pre>$ md5deep -m known-hashes.txt *
/home/jessek/tmp/a-matching-file.doc
/home/jessek/tmp/some-other-file.gif</pre>

If you want to see the hashes along with the filenames, you can use the
<tt>-M</tt>  flag instead.

<pre>$ md5deep -M known-hashes.txt *
65e7d67f9dbc831d4334f23c7fb9cfb1 /home/jessek/tmp/a-matching-file.doc
406f25e49e9e08bb859b574a96746177 /home/jessek/tmp/some-other-file.gif</pre>

If you need to match against a single hash, or would like to add a
single hash to the set of known hashes, you can use the <tt>-a</tt> flag.
This flag enables matching mode and add a single hash.

<pre>$ md5deep -a 65e7d67f9dbc831d4334f23c7fb9cfb1 *
/home/jessek/tmp/a-matching-file.doc</pre>

If you would like to see filename of the known file that generated the
match, use the <tt>-w</tt> flag. Continuing our example:

<pre>$ md5deep -wM known-hashes.txt *
65e7d67f9dbc831d4334f23c7fb9cfb1 /home/jessek/tmp/a-matching-file.doc matched foo.doc
406f25e49e9e08bb859b574a96746177 /home/jessek/tmp/some-other-file.gif matched bar.gif</pre>



<h3>Negative Matching</h3>

<p>
Negative matching is the same as positive matching, above, but displays
those files that are not in the list of known hashes. Negative matching
can be enabled using the <tt>-x</tt> flag, or the <tt>-X</tt> flag if
you want to see the hashes along with the filenames. The <tt>-A</tt>
flag will add a single hash to the set of hashes.

</p>

<br>
<h2 id="advmatch"> Advanced Matching Modes </h2>

<h3> Which File Matched </h3>

First, the -w mode can be used
to see which file an input matched. For example, let's say we have 
a file of known hashes, <tt>known.txt</tt> that we're matching against.
Normally we see a list of input files that matched any known file:

<pre>$ md5deep -m known.txt *
/home/jessek/an-input-file.txt
/home/jessek/another-matching-file.txt</pre>

When we add the -w mode to the command line, we see the filename in the
list of known files that matched.

<pre>$ md5deep -wm known.txt *
/home/jessek/an-input-file.txt matched EVILEVIL.EXE
/home/jessek/another-matching-file.txt matched san-dimas-high-school.jpg</pre>

The -w flag only works with positive matching, or -m mode. Attempting to
use -w mode with negative matching produces no more information that
negative matching does normally:

<pre>$ md5deep -wx known.txt *
/home/jessek/unknown-file does NOT match</pre>

</p>

<h3> Unused Hashes </h3>

<p>
The second advanced matching mode, -n, indicates which known hashes were
not matched by any of the input files. Using our example from above,
let's say our file of known hashes, <tt>known.txt</tt> looked like this:

<pre>
3668422d5b728776cb8720de8496abc9  san-dimas-high-school.jpg
b85444c8b82f208ad24e41f20c2b1831  EVILEVIL.EXE
6e43e96bde5c9f8abdbc47661cf4975b  never-seen-again.dat</pre>

If we run md5deep with the -n flag, we will get a listing of any hashes
that were not matched to an input file. 

<pre>$ md5deep -nm known.txt *
never-seen-again.dat</pre>

</p>


<br>
<h2 id="expert"> Expert Mode </h2>

md5deep's expert mode allows you to specify which and only which types of
files are processed. The available file types are:

<ul>
<li> Regular files, such as text, graphics, and executables.

<li> Block files, such as devices, hard drives, tape drives, CDROMs, etc. 

<li> Character devices, such as /dev/tty. 

<li> Named Pipes

<li> Symbolic Links - Soft links. Note that this option tells the program 
to follow a symbolic link <em>provided</em> that you have also specified
the parameter for whatever the link is pointing to. That is, if the 
symlink points to a directory, you must have also specified -r. If the 
symbolic links points to a regular file, you must have also specified
the -o f mode.

<li> Socket - Network connections

<li> Solaris Door - Available only on Solaris

</ul>

To use expert mode, use the <tt>-o</tt> flag followed by the letter or
letters corresponding to the types of files you want to process.

<br>
<br>

<table border="1" align="center">

<tr>
  <td><b>File type</b></td>
  <td><b>Letter</b></td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>Regular</td>
  <td>f</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>Block</td>
  <td>b</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>Character</td>
  <td>c</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>Named Pipe</td>
  <td>p</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>Symbolic Link</td>
  <td>l</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>Socket</td>
  <td>s</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>Solaris Door</td>
  <td>d</td>
</tr>

</table>
<br>

Let's say that in the current directory there are files hda (a block device),
my-link, a symbolic link to a block device, and data.txt, a regular file.

<pre>$ md5deep -o f *
2e1582d37db445402faee0fc331e9032  /home/jessek/data.txt
$</pre>

Note that only the regular files are hashed. Conversely:

<pre>$ md5deep -o lb *
ee1615f01210aa22c27058db161d2160  /home/jessek/hda
7fa749a2ea2cc635c77eb0a5370b93b0  /home/jessek/my-link
$</pre>

Note that the <a href="#recursive">recursive mode</a> can be used
in conjunction with the expert mode. Directories are ignored without
the recursive flag.
